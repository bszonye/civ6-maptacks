# Map Tacks 3.0.0 [<img align="right" src="maptacks.png" height="256" width="256">](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1122081356)
The Map Tacks mod is now
[included in Civilization VI](https://civilization.com/news/entries/civilization-vi-gathering-storm-patch-update-april-2019/)!

This optional add-on makes a few small changes to the official interface:

* improves the editor layout for Gathering Storm districts
* fixes some in-game text that still refers to map _pins_ instead of _tacks._

## Compatibility
The Map Tacks mod does not affect saved games, so you can add it to a game in
progress or disable it without breaking your game.  It overrides any map pin
features in other UI mods.  Map Tacks is compatible with Unique District Icons,
and uses the unique icons for districts.
